# Keylogger

This Python script is a simple keylogger that captures and logs keyboard inputs. It utilizes the `keyboard` library to hook into the keyboard events and record the pressed keys. The captured keys are then printed to the console and saved to a text file for later analysis.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `keylogger.py`.
2. The keylogger will start capturing keyboard inputs.
3. Press any key to record it.
4. The captured keys will be printed to the console and saved in a text file.

```bash
# Example command
$ python keylogger.py
